# Contribution Guidelines
Its a Github Wiki, so we welcome any contributions. The easiest and self contained contribution is probably a "Walkthrough" or "How-To" article. These can be written by anyone and simply explain how to accomplish some sort of mod, like add a new unit or change some settings.

Normal contribution process is to clone the wiki locally, create a branch with your changes in it and then make a Pull Request for that branch for people to look at and approve.
