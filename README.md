# What is this repository?
This repository represents one persons attempt to collate resources for modding Total War Warhammer.

Right now it's primary purpose is to contain a Wiki (that will hopefully be expanded with more and more information to help people mod the game in a consistent and compatible way), but might be extended to do other things like track ongoing modding projects.

The actual wiki can be found [here](http://github.com/tww-modding/tww-modding/wiki).

The Total War Warhammer modding community can be found in a few places:
* Hanging around in [/r/totalwar](http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar)
* Rambling in [Discord - Total War: Warhammer Mods](https://discord.gg/bA5eNUX)
* Theres another Discord channel as well [Discord - Total Lorehammer](https://discord.gg/s9tnyQT)
* [TWCenter Forums](http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?2197-Total-War-WARHAMMER-Mod-Workshop)
* [Steam Community Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WHTWmod)

The Discord groups are pretty active.

# Contribution Guidelines
On the off chance that people want to contribute to this repository (specifically the Wiki), its pretty standard Git stuff. Clone -> Pull Request -> Merge. At this point only one person has the ability to do things, because the Repository/Organisation is still very new.

This section will probably be updated if this starts to gain traction.
